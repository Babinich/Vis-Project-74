"# Vis-Project-74" 
This is our group's project reposetory. In this file I will quickly explain evey fail that we currently are working with.

Data -> It contains two data sets, "filter_data.csv" and "team_data.csv". "team_data.csv" is the main file with all necessary data for visulisation.

src/components -> Inside this folder we store every components and layouts used for visualisation. All callbacks are being coded inside given component. That's the only place where we can implement callbacks. Every component has it's own ID. Every ID is listed in "ids.py".

scatter_lot.py -> creates main scatter plot

x_axis_dropdown.py -> dropdown reponsible for x axis

y_axis_dropdown.py -> dropdown reponsible for y axis

filter.py -> filters the data by the groups stage, teams and knockout stage

search_bar.py -> allows for detecting given data point in scatter plot (needs more development)

ids.py -> contains all ids of every component

layout.py -> specifies the layout of the app
